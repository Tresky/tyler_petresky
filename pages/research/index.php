				As an Undergraduate Research Assistant I have conducted research into 
				computer engineering with an application in automated water sampling.
				I worked with the Environmental Engineering Department to design, build,
				and deploy an automatic water sampler that contains special features such as
				remote configuration and activation via cell phone, portability, and affordability.
