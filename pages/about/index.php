	<p>
	<b>Hello! I'm Tyler Petresky!</b><br><br>

		Currently, I am a second year student at the University of Central Florida (UCF). I was
		born and raised in Milton, Fl and recently moved to Orlando to pursue my bachelor's
		degree in Computer Engineering. I find computers and computer systems to be extremely
		fascinating. Because of this interest, my primary passions lie in embedded electronics
		and computer programming.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		I have not been at UCF for very long, but during the short span that I have attended this
		school, I have done several things. First and foremost, I have learned a lot. The courses
		that I have taken have taught me plenty, however, I am under the impression that your
		education is what you make it. The majority of the knowledge that I have acquired since
		arriving in Orlando has been gained from working on personal projects and joining engineering
		clubs such as Engineers Without Borders (EWB).
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		I have been doing computer programming for close to 10 years now and have loved every second
		of it. Over the years, I have gathered experience in languages such as C++, Python, Java,
		HTML/CSS, PHP, and more. Using these languages I have created various projects ranging from
		this website all the way to a tile engine library in C++ (known as SfTileEngine on Github).
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		As time continues to progress, I will continue to learn as much as I can while making as large
		of an impact on the world as possible.
	</p>

		<p>
		During my 8th grade year, a friend of mine came to school with a new skill in mind.
		He introduced me to a programming language called C++. I thought this was the coolest
		thing in the world and instantly fell in love with computer programming. Over the next
		year, we worked together to learn as much as we could about C++ and programming in general.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Eventually, I began to do bigger and better projects and changed my college interests from
		Astronomy to Computer Programming. Not long after that, during my Junior year of high school,
		I was introduced to someone who did robotics and he brought embedded electronics to my eye.
		I instantly went out and bought an Arduino hobby board and began to tinker with hooking up
		LED's, wiring sensors, and eventually designing entire systems. I had decided that my major
		was to be Computer Engineering.
